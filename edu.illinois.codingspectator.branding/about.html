<h2>About CodingSpectator</h2>
 
<h3>README</h3>

<p><a href="http://codingspectator.cs.illinois.edu">CodingSpectator</a> is an Eclipse plug-in developed at the University of Illinois. This plug-in listens for various actions that the user performs while working with Eclipse. CodingSpectator gathers a rich set of data about the usage of Eclipse that could reveal many interesting patterns in the usage of this IDE.</p>

<p>CodingSpectator saves the captured events locally and uploads them to a designated server periodically. It also categorizes the data based on the user id and Eclipse workspace id.</p>

<p>CodingSpectator is licensed under the Illinois/NCSA Open Source License. See LICENSE.TXT for more details.</p>
